# DS-241-Portfolio
This repository contains some of the rmd files that I worked on in my Introduction to Data Science class. The projects I worked on were introductory-level tutorials and guided assignments that taught the basics of filtering, grouping, joining, and general visualization and interpretation of data.

COVID.Rmd: This project stemmed from an existing Rmd file of a basic but well documented analysis of covid cases by country. Key concepts from this were literate programming and the use of the tidyverse package.

COVID_states.Rmd: This is an extension of the work we did in the previous project, only with less guidance. The goal was to plot the deaths per day by state, and then eventually cumulative cases over time, although I was unable to complete this final step.

MA132_Enrollment2.Rmd: This was one of the first projects I worked on, its purpose was to give us practice using the tidyverse, tidyr, and janitor packages. We ultimately did a linear regression analysis after fitering and grouping the data.

lab04: This was guided tutorial in which I was challenged with answering the question, "is La Quinta close to Denny's?" The process of answering this question involved some data filtering, mutating, and joining, as well as some preliminary visualization. Despite putting several hours into this lab, I wasn't able to fully complete it or do a hard analysis, but I am proud of the work I did complete.

dc_bike_rentals.Rmd: This was the start of what ultimately became the final project for this course. Before I corrected it to be consistent with the rest of the class, I took a very different approach to answering the proposed objective (compute ridership over time). This taught me that understanding the task at hand can be much more difficult than one might assume since I spent much time and effort on a methodology that was inconsistent with the expectations.
